## Cybersecurity Study Group | Community Founder  
I created and hosted the **Cybersecurity Study Group**, which consisted of a core group of TSTC students. Over 90% of our group graduated as honor students.  

I'm passionate about fostering a strong cybersecurity community and growing our collective knowledge. My goal was to create a space where like-minded students could connect, collaborate, and gain practical experience.  

Within this community, I shared my knowledge of the cybersecurity methods taught in TSTC's program and provided guidance to my peers. The group elevated our learning experience and helped forge meaningful bonds.  

The **Cybersecurity Study Group** was hosted and maintained solely by me, with support from other TSTC students.
